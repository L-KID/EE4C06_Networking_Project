This folder is set to contain the figures auto-generated by the MATLAB code.

To avoid including the figures in commits, files with the extension of `.fig` and `.png ` are set not be tracked by git using `.gitignore`.

To keep the directory after using `.gitignore`, a `README.md` is added to each sub-folder.
(Git is not in favor of empty folders. See [this link](https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitFaq#Can_I_add_empty_directories.3F) for more info.)
